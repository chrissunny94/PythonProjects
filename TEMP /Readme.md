DevPhase:1   DeadLine:16-8-2015

We try to see how many of our outcomes have already been done by others.
Evidence of this would be academic papers , opensource codes/projects and blog-post's/walkthorouhgs

- [ ] Get a couple of good working algorithms.

DevPhase:2   DeadLine:23-8-2015
- [ ] Using these algorithms "Detect Objects and identify them"

Once we have this we should start work on how we can use them all together .

Dlib does a good job of sketching out the strong points of a persons face , this sketch could be used as the datafeed for neural networks.
