Convolutional Neural Net:
________________________________________________________________________________________

Roughly how this works is as follows


consider a weights matrix of 


1  2  3  4
5  6  7  8 
9  10 11 12
13 14 15 16



Lets say that we have a square which is like below

0  0  0  0
0  1  1  0
0  1  1  0
0  0  0  0


Now when we multiply this with the weights matrix we get something like 

6+7+10+11=34




Now lets try another shape 

0  1  0  0
1  0  0  1
0  0  0  0
1  0  1  0

Now this when multiplied with the weights matrix will return something like


2+5+8+13+15=43


So now if we run the weights matrix over  a huge area with the same shapes it will churn out the same value indicating that in that region there exists such and such shapes

Possible algorithm

Lets say we have a good Weights matrix , now lets run the matrix over the entire image .
This will result in what could be considered as a contour map .
This map could be then used to figuer out the regions where a face exists .
Now the data set will also be continous . We will also be looking into the gradient of the neurla network as well .



Gradient of a face would be very much unique for a good weights matrix and vice versa.
