# balltracker 

# details of this project are as follows:  
Need python script/exe that will take a video file as an input.  When executed with the video file input the script/exe will analyze the video, identify when a ball comes into frame, track the ball as it moves, and calculate two velocities of the ball.  The first velocity is the average velocity as the ball approaches the player in the frame and the second velocity is the average velocity as the ball moves away from the player.  The output of the script will be the playing of the video with texts/labels in the upper corner of the frame (which ever side the ball first comes into frame) the contain (1) “PV: “ & [velocity of ball moving toward player] (2) “EV: “ & [velocity of ball moving away from player] .  The text/labels should be in the opposite side of where ever the player is.
Video input requirements will be a minimum frame rate of 60fps and that the players is always on the edge of the frame (left or right).
