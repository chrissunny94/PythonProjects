Convolutional Neural Net:

Roughly how this works is as follows


consider a weights matrix of 


1  2  3  4
5  6  7  8 
9  10 11 12
13 14 15 16



Lets say that we have a square which is like below

0  0  0  0
0  1  1  0
0  1  1  0
0  0  0  0


Now when we multiply this with the weights matrix we get something like 

6+7+10+11=34




Now lets try another shape 

0  1  0  0
1  0  0  1
0  0  0  0
1  0  1  0

Now this when multiplied with the weights matrix will return something like


2+5+8+13+15=43


So now if we run the weights matrix over  a huge area with the same shapes it will churn out the same value indicating that in that region there exists such and such shapes
