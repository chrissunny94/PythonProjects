Instructions for using the dlib library





IMP:
sudo su
nautilus
go to the python_examples folder and delete the build folder 

(you will need the complile the .bat file again)

1) sudo apt-get install libboost-python-dev cmake

2) cd to dlib-18.15/python_examples

3) ./compile_dlib_python_module.bat 

4) sudo cp dlib.so /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/

5) sudo apt-get install python-scipy

6) sudo apt-get install python-numpy

7) sudo apt-get install python-cython

8) sudo apt-get install python-six

9) sudo apt-get install python-skimage



for executing the face-landmark... you will need to download the template from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/dclib/files/dlib/v18.10/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2/download



This example program shows how to find frontal human faces in an image and
#   estimate their pose.  The pose takes the form of 68 landmarks.  These are
#   points on the face such as the corners of the mouth, along the eyebrows, on
#   the eyes, and so forth.
#
#   This face detector is made using the classic Histogram of Oriented
#   Gradients (HOG) feature combined with a linear classifier, an image pyramid,
#   and sliding window detection scheme.  The pose estimator was created by
#   using dlib's implementation of the paper:
#      One Millisecond Face Alignment with an Ensemble of Regression Trees by
#      Vahid Kazemi and Josephine Sullivan, CVPR 2014
#   and was trained on the iBUG 300-W face landmark dataset.
#
#   Also, note that you can train your own models using dlib's machine learning
#   tools. See train_shape_predictor.py to see an example.
#
#   You can get the shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat file from:
#   http://sourceforge.net/projects/dclib/files/dlib/v18.10/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2
#
# COMPILING THE DLIB PYTHON INTERFACE
#   Dlib comes with a compiled python interface for python 2.7 on MS Windows. If
#   you are using another python version or operating system then you need to
#   compile the dlib python interface before you can use this file.  To do this,
#   run compile_dlib_python_module.bat.  This should work on any operating
#   system so long as you have CMake and boost-python installed.
#   On Ubuntu, this can be done easily by running the command:
#       sudo apt-get install libboost-python-dev cmake
#
#   Also note that this example requires scikit-image which can be installed
#   via the command:
#       pip install -U scikit-image
#   Or downloaded from http://scikit-image.org/download.html.
